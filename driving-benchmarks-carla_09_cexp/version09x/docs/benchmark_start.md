## Benchmarking


This repository replaces the benchmarking repo of the CARLA repository
It receives an experience description file (json file) 

There are also alias that automatically generate the benchmarks
for some of the main benchmarks showed on papers.

### Getting Started 
 

You just need to have [the CARLA environment generator up and running](https://github.com/felipecode/cexp/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md)
and add it to your PYTHONPATH

    export PYTHONPATH=<path_to_carla_experience>:$PYTHONPATH

### Benchmark some published benchmarks
